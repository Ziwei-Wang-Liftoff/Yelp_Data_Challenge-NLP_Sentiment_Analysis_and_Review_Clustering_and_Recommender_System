## Project Objectives

• Through this project, we had three main tasks:
- 1. **Classified negative and positive reviews** by a self-defined metric. 
    - After the model fitting, gained insights about what words usually contribute to the negative or positive review. 
    - A restaurant can summarize what's the main aspects the customers care about, so that make corresponding improvement to attract more customers.
- 2. Used unsupervised learning to **cluster reviews into groups**. 
    - Clustered positive reviews of all business in "Las Vegas" into groups
        - By finding the top 10 features of centroid of each cluster, we can get information about the key features of different type of business, thus, if you’re going to start a new business in such type, you can pay more attention to these key features which customer care mostly.
    - Clustered reviews of the most reviewed restaurant in "Las Vegas" into groups
        - By inspecting the cluster centroids, identified and understood the common user preference within each of the group, providing information for market promotion strategy.
- 3. **Built a restaurant recommender system** using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization based on users’ past visits and ratings.
